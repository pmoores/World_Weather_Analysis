# Module 6 Challenge - WeatherPy Plan My Trip App

## Purpose
Change the code for the PlanMyTrip app to:
- add the weather description to the weather data that was already retrieved
- have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels
- have the beta tester choose four cities to create a travel itinerary
- use the Google Maps Directions API, to create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
